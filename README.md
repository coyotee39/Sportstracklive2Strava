Sportstracklive2Strava
======================
Imports gpx zip file from Sportstracklive.com and uploads to Strava.com

- Why?
Well, a couple of friends told me, I should go to use Strava, because that's the big whoosa right now. But I already got an account at Sportstracklive and thus a bunch of gpx files there.
So I didn't want to spend whole night on clicking.........I wish I did.
But hey, that's not fun. I started creating this script at the 'Sioux weekend of Code', a nerd meeting from my employer and a lot of beer.
Maybe you can use it. Otherwise, just go further with the things, you where busy with in the first place.

- How to use?
Tested with python 2.7
Just call "python SportsTrackLive2Stava.py"
You need to enter the credentials for both sites. Don't worry, no voodoo is happening with your credentials.
Make sure you put in the correct credentials, because it will say it succeeded, but it will not.
A nice error handling is not completely there yet, but the happy case works. Don't like it? Stop whining and help me.

- Future plans?
Maybe, it's quite error prone, because both sites don't provide an api, so some site scraping / reverse engineering is done.
This will work as long their site is the same. Maybe if I have the time I will keep it working, otherwise help me to help yourself and others.
